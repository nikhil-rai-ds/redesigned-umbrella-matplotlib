    "As you learnt in the session, data visualisation is an essential skill for a data scientist to have. Charts and graphs are the easiest way to communicate data to different kinds of consumers. The assessments in this notebook will test your ability to represent information. The questions will be investigative and will not have detailed instructions about the execution; you will have to figure that part out yourself. Don't worry, there are no wrong answers here, only happy accidents. Try these questions on your own, to verify if you have done the task correctly, look at the solution as a person who does not know the data and is looking at it for the first time. You will be able to identify better ways to represent data automatically.  \n",
